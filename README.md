# Randstad-Academy

Folder "Java Plain"

The "Java Plain" folder contains a series of Java projects completed during the training experience at Randstad Academy. These projects are examples that demonstrate the implementation of basic concepts and structures in the Java language. They include basic applications, algorithms, data structures, programming principles, and case studies, developed without the use of external frameworks or libraries.

Folder "Spring"

The "Spring" folder contains projects developed during the course at Randstad Academy, focused on the use of the Spring framework. These projects include web applications and RESTful APIs built using Spring Boot, which is a rapid application development tool for Spring Framework-based applications. The examples implement advanced concepts such as entity management, database connection, CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and other aspects of developing Spring-based applications. The main objective of this section is to provide a practical and applied understanding of how to use Spring and its features to build and manage complex Java applications.

Folder "FinalTest Java-Spring"

The "FinalTest Java-Spring" folder gathers the last two projects completed at the end of the backend training path at Randstad Academy. These projects represent the culmination of the training experience, combining both basic Java programming concepts (Java Plain) and advanced implementation using the Spring framework.

Folder "Angular"

The "Angular" folder hosts a front-end project developed with the Angular framework. This front-end project was created to apply advanced web development concepts using Angular, an open-source TypeScript framework for building client-side applications. The content of the "Angular" folder includes various modules and components that handle different aspects of the application, such as page navigation, user interface management, HTTP requests to backend servers, data validation, and more. This project demonstrates the practical and applied implementation of Angular for creating sophisticated and dynamic user interfaces for web applications.
